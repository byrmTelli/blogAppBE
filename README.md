<>This is another project that i built to keep fresh my mind about JWT(Json Web Token) implementation and EFCore, LINQ fundamentals. You can directly clone the project and replace your own database connection string before run the app. I used postgresql in this project, so if you want to run this app with another databases you need to make a couple changes on packages and configurations.</p>
